## 👋 Who We Are

Arqetype is the digital studio of two French engineering students. We craft software with the same attention to detail we admire in great architecture, typography, and user experience. Our work blends rigorous backend thinking with refined interface design.
### 👨‍💻 Pierre GUEROULT  
[https://pierregueroult.dev](https://pierregueroult.dev)  
Frontend-focused fullstack engineer who enjoys building clean, expressive interfaces. Pierre brings structure and aesthetic clarity to every product — and always finds time for a long-distance run.

### 🧑‍💻 Clément OMNÈS  
[https://clementomnes.dev](https://clementomnes.dev)  
Backend-leaning fullstack engineer passionate about elegant APIs, architecture, and developer experience. Clément builds with precision — and practices Kung Fu with the same intensity.

We’re both fullstack engineering students who love great design, strong systems, and making tools that feel good to use.
